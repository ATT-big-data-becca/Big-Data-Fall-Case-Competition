# Big-Data-Fall-Case-Competition
Welcome to the Big Data at AT&T Fall Regional Case Competition page!

We are glad you are interested in participating in the Big Data Fall Case Compeititon! 
You can find the uploaded competition write-up under the Code tab. 

For project submissions, please upload your project on your github account and add me as a contributor (@ATT-big-data-becca).
This will allow me to be able to download and review your project results. 
It’s okay if not everyone has a github account, as long as one person in the group does.

If no one on your team has a github account, that is okay! It’s free and easy to set up. 
Go ahead and create one account to upload the signed "Disclaimer" document and your project results. 
Make sure to all team members have signed the document. 
I will not be able to review any submissions without signed "Disclaimer" forms.
